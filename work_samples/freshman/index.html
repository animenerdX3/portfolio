					<h2><i>Making a Database with Queries</i></h2>
					<h2>March 30, 2015</h2>
					<h3><a class="docLink" href="docs/Work_Sample_Database_Essay.pdf">Click Here To Open PDF</a></h3>
					<p>During my freshman year in Information Technology, I managed to learn how queries work and using them in Microsoft Access. First, I applied what I learned about Select Queries to research specific information about a table. Then, I exploited Make-Table Queries to create tables from the information I retained from the master table. Finally, I analyzed Append Queries to adjust or merge data from other tables. Learning this skill provided me with an advantage to know an important skill that can be applicable to a workplace for jobs to be a lot simpler and progress more efficiently.</p>

						<figcaption>Inserting the Fields for the <br /> Select Query.</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>First of all, to create a select query I selected the create tab and chose query design to forge a new query. Then, I exercised the “Show Table” window and decided to analyze the table called “Initial Stats” that I used for the base of the entire project. Before I entered any criteria, I clicked “Select” in the section called “Query Type” because if I started to progress into my work and then select the query, some information would have the chance to be erased. Furthermore, I inserted fields below the work space that I wanted to work with (which in this case, every field). My main objective for the query happened to be interpreting the Infielders on the main table, since the table based on baseball statistics. So, under the Position field that I created and in the row labelled “Criteria”, I entered the code “i*” so the program could calculate every row of data that contains something under the field “Position” that starts with the letter “I”.  Lastly, I executed the program by pressing the “Run” button under Results, which produced the result of 5 Infielders with all of their fields.</p>

					</figure>
					<p>The next query named a Make-Table query, I started out copying the same thing I did previously to establish a brand new query. In the same fashion, I selected the same table as last time, but uniquely, I chose Make-Table instead of Select under “Query Design”.  In addition, I named the table I almost created with this query “Infielders”, because I almost going to seclude the Infielders from the main table, and pressed “Ok”. I input the same fields as last time as well as the criteria. Finally, I ran the query and the program confirmed to me that I pasted five rows of data into a new table, and hit “Yes”.  A new table called “Infielders” generated and it contained the rows that contained Infielders in the “Position” field.</p>

						<figcaption>Entering the Fields For the <br />Append Query.</figcaption>
					</figure>					
					<p>I once again fabricated another query through the create tab and choosing query design. I then singled out a table I made called “Outfielders” (a table that contains every Outfielder from the “Initial Stats” table). Before working on the query, under “Query Type” I chose “Append” to start constructing an append query. The software asked me to choose a table to append to, so I determined to use the “Batters” table (I previously copied and pasted the “Infielders” and renamed it “Batters”) and hit “Ok”. Afterwards, I began selecting the fields I wanted to merge, and the row called “Append To” started to auto-fill because the program recognized that in both tables, the field names happened to result in exact matches. Once all the fields happened to have been chosen, I performed “Run” in the “Results” area, the program asked if I wanted to append seven rows and I opted for “Yes”. Finally, I opened up the “Batters” table and saw 7 new rows that contained Outfielders in the “Position” field.</p>

					<p>Learning this gave me an advantage over others to improve the workplace. I utilized select queries to find specific data in a table. Furthermore, I performed a make-table query to separate information into different tables. Last, but not least, I made use of append queries to merge information from one table and allocate it into another. This happens to be just a taste of my understanding of making queries in Microsoft Access.</p>

					<h2><i>Work Sample- Making a PowerPoint about Hardware</i></h2>
					<h2>May 22, 2015</h2>
					<h3><a class="docLink" href="docs/Work_Sample_Hardware.pdf">Click Here To Open PDF</a></h3>
					<p>In Freshman year of Computer Information Technology, I got educated about hardware, an essential part to the IT Field. First of all, I googled information on my specific pieces of hardware, heat sinks and graphic cards. Then, my group and I created a PowerPoint based on what I learned. Lastly, our group presented the PowerPoint and explained the data that wasn’t present on the slides. All in all, I had decent time learning about what is inside a computer.</p>

						<figcaption>Research Information on a <br />Microsoft Word <br />Document.</figcaption>
					</figure>				
					<p>First of all, I analyzed information about heat sinks and found out so much about them. For example, heat sinks are manufactured out of copper or aluminum alloys. I then learned about graphic cards in the same manner as I did about heat sinks. I found out graphic cards are printed circuit boards (PCBs) that sends pixels to display and provide specific type of processing using graphical progressing unit (GPU). Then, my associates alongside me copied the information onto a Microsoft Word Document for a reference to later for our demonstration. This was an essential step to pulling the entire project together.</p>

						<figcaption>Example Slide about Stores to <br />Purchase Graphic Cards.</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>When we got all of our information, I needed to find out how to present this newly found data. Logically, we collected all the information we needed and started a new PowerPoint called “Hardware- Heat Sinks and Graphic Cards”. To create a basic background for the information to be presented on, I applied a basic Grid theme to all slides under the “Design" and added a textured background style behind the grids. Lastly, I constructed ten slides with my group with everything we learned and supported with faded transitions between each slide and animation that is mature enough to present our data formally.</p>

					<p>The skills I learned while doing this may give me a higher advantage over others.We studied about heat sinks and graphic cards at the very beginning. We then conceived a PowerPoint based on the facts that we investigated for. Lastly, we bestowed our knowledge to the class. This is some proof of my knowledge on finding data and presenting it formally to others.</p>
