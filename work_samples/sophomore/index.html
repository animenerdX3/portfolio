					<h2><i>Creating a Switchboard in Microsoft Access</i></h2>
					<h2>January 4, 2016</h2>
					<h3><a class="docLink" href="docs/WS_Switchboards.pdf">Click Here To Open PDF</a></h3>
					
					<p>During my sophomore year at Greater New Bedford Voc-Tech in Programming and Web Development, I learned a new way to connect pieces of a Microsoft Access database together using a mechanism called a switchboard. First, I retrieved the Switchboard Manager command from a list of hidden commands. Afterwards, I tinkered with the controller to format pages into a main page, making sure everything functioned properly. Lastly, I manipulated the settings to cause the form to appeal to me visually. Using my new skill, I can now connect data and make the database user-friendly.</p>
					
					<figure class="figureright">

						<figcaption>A Print screen of The Database <br/> with the Access Option Open <br/>and the Customize Ribbon <br/> text selected.</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>As I looked to generate the Switchboard, I could not find the option anywhere. The first thing I did to begin solving this dilemma is I directed myself to the Access Options window by clicking File in the ribbon and Options in the directory. Once I chose the Window, I opted for the tab “Customize Ribbon”. I tried to search for the command in the “Popular Commands” category. In order to acquire it, I searched under the “All Commands” section. Finally, I created a new group to place the command in under the section “Database Tools” and inserted the Switchboard manager inside of the category. As a result, an option to open a Switchboard manager was now available for use. </p>

						<figcaption>A Print screen of the <br/> Switchboard Window open.</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>Now that I could use the controller, I chose the command from the ribbon. A window opened up that asked me if I wanted to make a new Switchboard and I replied with yes by selecting the Yes button. A larger window with only a Main Page appeared. In order to start forging new pages, I picked the “New…” button. The program prompted me to create a name in which I called the page “Forms”. I repeated the process to make another page called “Reports”. Once I built the page, I double-clicked the name and alternated to another window where I could decide what demanded to be constructed within that page. I managed to construct three pages the each lead to another sub-page. Inside of each sub-page (which I established in the section of the manager where the Main Page is located and fastened them to the “Forms” page) are two links to a form. One adds new records to the forms and the other can fabricate records and edit existing records. For the “Reports” page, there are two links that attach to each report in the database. Now that the pages were produced, I needed to ensure that I can direct myself throughout the entire controller. I lacked a Switchboard Item to each page (excluding the Main Page) called “Back” so I can guide myself to previous sections. First, I pressed “Edit…” on the page I changed. After I pressed the button, a new window appeared and I chose “New…” I entered “Back” where the window told me to enter text. Out of the options shown in Dropdown menus, I settled “Go to Switchboard” for the Command and “Main Page” for the Switchboard (since I was on the Forms page) and selected Ok. I did the same instructions for each page besides the Main Page. For the Default Page, I made a link that exited the program instead. After everything was said and done, the controller functioned properly.

						<figcaption>The final product for the <br />Main Page.</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>While everything operated suitably, the form did not strike me as appealing. Before anything else, I switched the form into Design View so a new set of tools were now available at my disposal. I right clicked the header and favored the Properties option. A side bar appeared and I wandered to the Back Color area since the color did not soothe me. I altered the color to a dark red, which automatically made the form improve a lot cosmetically. I repeated the initial task to the links and the text colors, ending with a dark red header, light red and white backgrounds to each link, a white title, and black links. The sections for the links were slightly smaller than I hoped. In Design View, I grabbed the edge of the Detail section and dragged it down, which resized each link into the size I preferred. Lastly, I used “Insert Image” in the Design tab and fixed a picture to each link and a different image next to the title in the header. Although it was tedious getting the final result, it worked out just fine.
					</p>
					
					<p>Overall, I found the task rather simple to do and amusing. Obtaining the Switchboard manager was an easy task, but the task would have been nearly impossible without knowing where to find the options. I then amended the controller and its pages which came to me easily. Last, but not least, I tampered with the form settings and view which I enjoyed being creative. This task was easily done and very useful to learn in the field of database.

					<h2><i>Mapping Images and Anchors</i></h2>
					<h2>February 4, 2016</h2>
					<h3><a class="docLink" href="docs/WS_MapAnchors.pdf">Click Here To Open PDF</a></h3>
					
					<p>During the middle of my sophomore year, I created a Webpage that produced the result of an image with anchors mapped into the file that directed to lists underneath the links. First, I transcribed a general idea of how the code would look like and function. Afterwards, I relocated the code onto Notepad in a file with the .htm extension. Lastly, I inspected the Website in Internet Explorer to self-evaluate the results. This new method of adding links helped me learn more efficient methods to use links.</p>

						<figcaption>Example of Handwritten Code.</figcaption>
					</figure>					
					<p>To start it all off, I restated the instructions given to me quietly to myself to ensure that I knew the process. For the assignment, I mapped out an image. Therefore, to find all of the coordinates, I pinpointed the coordinates on the image by observing the info tab in Photoshop and searching for the exact positions in needed. After I retrieved all of the information, I registered my plan for the page on the graph paper. With the written draft done, I continued on with the process of building the Webpage.</p>

						<figcaption>Code on Notepad.</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>With the written portion complete, in order for the site to actually function is with a digital copy. First off, I scanned my written paper for any syntax errors. Before I typed anything, I saved the document for precautions. The file extension I applied was .htm, one of the proper methods to document Websites. Lastly, I transferred whatever I wrote on the graph paper onto a digital copy. Now, with the code on my computer, I ended up acquiring a functional website file.</p>

						<figcaption>Picture of the Webpage.</figcaption>
					</figure>	
					<p>The only thing left to do with the HTML happened to be previewing it. First of all, I looked at the final product by launching the file (which I named index.htm) with the browser “Internet Explorer”. After reassuring the accuracy of the code, I captured a picture of the website using the Snipping Tool program on my PC. Ensuring that I showcased the entire page, I right clicked the picture contained within the Snipping Tool window and selected “Copy”. Lastly, I produced a new Microsoft Word document and pressed Ctrl and V to paste the picture onto the document. This process finalized the project and proved that I was cognizant of how the project functioned.</p>
				
					<p>Overall, this assignment went through simply and efficiently. When I wrote out the code, I found the task very simple. Shifting the code into a digital workspace went by smoothly, thanks to my slightly above par typing skills. Lastly, scrutinizing the webpage for any mistakes happened to take a very transient amount of time due to the fact I knew what I happened to be doing. This project is just a small, but useful, piece of information that I can now take and use in the Web Development field.</p>

					<h2><i>Making a Database: Regionals Practice</i></h2>
					<h2>April 1, 2016</h2>
					<h3><a class="docLink" href="docs/WS_RegionalPractice.pdf">Click Here To Open PDF</a></h3>
					
					<p>During Cycle 15 of Programming and Web Development, I practiced my skills in Database by performing the tasks asked for in the Regional 2013 Test for Database Applications. First, I completed Job 1: creating the table “Inventory pg21489”. Later on, I accomplished Job 3: mapping and enforcing a relationship between the Inventory and Sales tables. Afterwards, I executed Job 4: which instructed me to manufacture a Profit Query. Lastly, I achieved Job 6: forging a report for specific fields. With this practice, I effectively increased my knowledge in the field of Database administrations.</p>
					
					<figure class="figureright">

						<figcaption>A print screen of the table.</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>	The first objective I needed to complete turned out to be making a table. First and foremost, I constructed the six fields essential for the table’s function such as ID, product name, cost, in stock, minimum and re-order qty. Then, I ensured correct data types for each field so that each record’s format would end up accurate. After that, I transcribed all of the information given on the test into records inside the table. Finally, I saved the table under the name “Inventory pg21489” to keep all of my data. I now possessed a crucial part of the project.</p>
					
					<figure class="figureleft">
						<img src="images/worksample_3/table_relationships.png" alt="Table Relationships" width="224.64" height="180.48" align="left" />
						<figcaption>Relationship between the <br />two tables.</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>	Later into the project, I reached Job 3: blueprinting a relationship between two tables. To start off, I opened the relationships window and added the two existing tables (Inventory and Sales, which I manufactured after Job 1). Afterwards, I produced a one-to-one relationship by connecting the primary keys of each table. Finally, I saved the relationship, enforcing the integrity between the tables and finalizing the table’s connections. With this newly-bound relationship, the tables could now share their information, more specifically the product ID.</p>
					
					<figure class="figureright">
						<img src="images/worksample_3/profit_query_design.png" alt="Profit Query" width="224.64" height="180.48" align="right" />
						<figcaption>The Profit Query in <br />Design Mode.</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>	As I dug deeper into the tasks, I confronted Job 4: the queries. When I began the query, I started annexing a few fields to the query. Afterwards, I formulated another field called “Gross Sales” applying the builder tool to brainstorm a function (the field contained the values of the fields “Qty Sold” times “Retail Price”). I then composed another field called “Product Cost” operating the builder tool for one more expression the incorporated “Qty Sold” times “Cost”. Finally, I set up the Profit field with information straight from the query itself (“Gross Sales” times “Product Cost”). With the query done and working accordingly, I now acquired more information about the data from a single query.</p>

					<figure class="figureleft">
						<img src="images/worksample_3/report_print_preview.png" alt="Report Print Preview" width="224.64" height="180.48" align="left" />
						<figcaption>Print Preview of the report.</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>	I came to a close at Job 6: establishing the report. Before any construction of the report, I included a new field called “Order” (it contained a Yes/No data type) to the table. After a short time, I manipulated the Report Wizard to spawn specific fields subsumed into a report. Next, I combined a text field to the report called “Order Cost” because I needed to add a new field exclusively for the report. To end it all off, I changed the control source utilizing the builder to affix an expression to the text boxes (Re-Order Qty times Cost). With this completed, I obtained the data in a much neater and organized way.</p>

					<p>	Doing this project taught me many innovative ways to organize data. I concocted a table called “Inventory” which held different sorts of fields. I organized a relationship between two tables to integrate changes in information. Later, I devised a query to find out about certain aspects of the data that took almost an instant to see. Lastly, I shaped a report to organize certain fields from a table in a neat method. With my new knowledge, I  now own the intellect and skill to process data in the workforce.</p>
