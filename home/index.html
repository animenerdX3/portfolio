						<h2>About Me</h2>
						<p>
							My name is Peter Gomes and I am from Greater New Bedford Regional Vocational Technical High School. During my time there, I focused my studies on Information Technology (more specifically, Programming and Web Development). While in class, I studied multiple topics. Some of them include HTML, CSS, Java / Object Oriented Programming, Logic Structuring, Binary, Hexadecimal, Photoshop, and Database. I am currently certified in Microsoft PowerPoint, Word, Excel, and Access 2010. I am hoping to pursue my studies in the field of gaming. I plan to go to Savannah College of Art and Design to study Computer Science while getting a Minor in Game Development. Throughout the time outside of school, I have been still active in my studies and development as a person. I have been maintaining a part-time job at T.J. Maxx while still managing to keep up with my grades. I have decided to spend my time participating in competitions such as SkillsUSA and Business Professionals of America. I am an active member of the National Honor Society. This website gives proof to the achievements and activities I decided to dedicate my time to.

					<h2 align="right">Programming</h2>
					<p>
						Throughout my high school career, I have been given the opportunity to build on my programming skills through Java. Over the past three years, I have been able to go from someone with barely any experience with code to one of the top programmers in my class. I have also competed in national competitions for Java Programming through Business Professionals of America. In Java, I have experience with Object-oriented programming, logic based skills, Java Applets, Java Applications, Java Swing, Slick2D, and LWJGL. I have taken these skills and have started opening my world to other languages such as Python and C#. Although I may have a strong foundation in purely Java, the techniques and logic sequencing I have learned can easily transition me into other high-level programming languages.

						<h2>HTML, CSS, Javascript</h2>
						<p>
							When it comes with the concept of Web Design, this is something that I have been familiar with for a long time. When I was 8 years old, I started creating web sites with the standard Web Site Builders such as <a href="http://spruz.com/">Spruz.com</a>, <a href="https://www.yola.com/">Yola.com</a>, <a href="https://www.wix.com/">Wix.com</a>, etc. Because of this introduction to Web Design, I started delving deeper into the subject. A few years later, I started experimenting with HTML and some CSS. Once I got into high school, my progress increased tenfold. I started competing nationally in Fundamentals of Web Design, learning how to use Javascript, and also testing the waters with PHP and MySQL. With the help fo my teachers, I have been able to gain a solid foundation on Web Design. Although this is not the field I plan to pursue, having the background certainly helps expand my knowledge in the computer science field.

					<h2 align="right">Graphic Design</h2>
					<p>
						I have always been fond of art throughout my life, and I always tend to see things through the creative light. I have been drawing since I was a little kid but have recently introduced myself to digital art. I have had experience using Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator for about 4 years now and used Paint Tool SAI to draw for a couple of years now. I take interest in Japanese art styles since I have an interest in the unique culture, so everything I work with involves this in some way. Thanks to my teachers through high school, I have been able to expand my horizons through both my programming side and my graphic design side. I honestly believe that my programming side may bit a bit stronger, but the addition of design to my projects helps express who I am as a person and lets my personality shine through my work.
